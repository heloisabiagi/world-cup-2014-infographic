# world-cup-2014-infographic
This infographic shines a light on the financial transations between teams and players during the **World Cup 2014**. It was built with **RaphaÃ«l.js**, a vector graphics library that solves browsers incompatibilities and makes working with HTML5 canvas, vectors and shapes way easier and more fun. 

## How it works ##
The first scene of the infographic gets data from a JSON file and turns it into a chart, where you can see the team values separated by the tournament groups. The second is a vector world map where you can see the data by navigating through groups and countries. Finally, the last one is a deeper look in each participant country, with the complete team data, coach, most valuable players, World Cup participations, wins, sponsors etc. The infographic is in Portuguese, but it's pretty self-explanatory.
